# MLOps Final Project: Exploratory Data Analysis & Experiment Tracking

This project demonstrates the application of **DataPrep** for automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and **Neptune.ai** for experiment tracking in machine learning workflows. The project utilizes the Titanic dataset to perform data analysis and track experiments, visualizations, and results.

## Files Included:
1. **MLOPS_Final_Project.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project, including data loading, EDA using DataPrep, and integration with Neptune.ai for experiment tracking.
2. **titanic_eda_report.html**: Generated HTML report containing the exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset.
3. **Final_Report.pdf**: A comprehensive report documenting the project process, methods, and insights.
4. **Final PPT SanjanaShailesh.pptx**: Final presentation summarizing the project results and key findings.

## Tools and Libraries Used:
- **DataPrep**: Automated tool for generating exploratory data analysis reports and visualizations.
- **Neptune.ai**: Platform for tracking experiments, visualizations, and results.
- **Seaborn**: For customized visualizations in the EDA process.

## Project Overview:
- **Data Preparation**: Using DataPrep to load the Titanic dataset and generate an automated EDA report.
- **Experiment Tracking**: Utilizing Neptune.ai to log experiments, track metrics, and visualize results for effective analysis and comparison.
- **Key Findings**: Gained insights into the Titanic dataset, including visualizing key variables and comparing different experiment runs.

## Setup Instructions:
1. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install neptune-client data-prep seaborn matplotlib
    ```
2. Run the Jupyter notebook (**MLOPS_Final_Project.ipynb**) to replicate the EDA and experiment tracking process.

## Conclusion:
This project showcases how to streamline data analysis and experiment tracking using powerful MLOps tools like DataPrep and Neptune.ai. It simplifies workflows for beginners while providing an intuitive way to manage machine learning experiments.
